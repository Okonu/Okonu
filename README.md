👋 Hi, I’m Ian Okonu  
🌱 I’m currently learning distributed systems design, systems programming with Go, and advanced Laravel internals to scale backend systems. I’m also deepening my knowledge in Python for automation, data processing, and AI integrations.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that involve scalable backend architectures, API security, and AI-powered developer tools.
