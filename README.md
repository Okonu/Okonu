👋 Hi, I’m Ian Okonu  
🌱 I’m currently learning distributed systems design, systems programming with Go, and advanced Laravel internals to scale backend systems. I’m also exploring AI integrations for developer tools.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that involve scalable backend architectures, API security, and AI-powered tools.
